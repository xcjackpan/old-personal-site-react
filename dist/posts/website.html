	<h1 class="title">Reflections on My Personal Site</h1>
	<p class="date">01/10/2018</p>

	<p class="text">
		I’m writing this after having re-designed my site twice, with a third time in the works. That should give you a pretty good idea of how much difficulty I’ve had with making a site I’m happy with. I started thinking about designs for my site way back in September, before I knew anything about web development. Let’s put it this way: at that time, I thought HTML was a programming language. Though the designs I came up with during this time were pretty questionable, I got a general idea of what I wanted on my site: an about page, my resume and portfolio, and a blog.
	</p>

	<h3 class="subheading">Coding</h3>

	<p class="text">
		The actual coding for my site wasn’t too difficult, but I do want to highlight the importance of having the right learning approach. 

		<br/><br/><br/>

		Before I started working on my site, I worked through a few HTML and CSS tutorials. But since I was pretty excited to get started, I figured I could just learn the rest as I went and I jumped right in. Through blind experimentation and sheer luck, I eventually had half of a decent-looking site working – except that the moment you resized the browser window, everything would fall apart. Not surprisingly, I was nowhere near as competent as I thought I was. It was about here when I realized I wouldn’t be able to just “figure it out” by myself. The solution, of course, was to work through a bunch more tutorials until I was a lot more confident in what I was doing. 

		<br/><br/><br/>

		I really wish there was some clever programming trick to talk about here, but to be honest, nearly all the problems I faced were the result of inexperience with a new language. With a more patient approach, I was able to get a functional site working fairly quickly.
	</p>

	<h3 class="subheading">Design</h3>

	<p class="text">
		Good designs are like diamonds – <i>they’re f**king hard</i>. If you Google “how to make media queries”, you get a bunch of pretty clear guides with some easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions. However, if you Google “how to design a good website”, you get a bunch of articles with really vague advice that’s not really even applicable a lot of the time. At least that’s how I felt when I was trying to figure out how to design my site. 

		<br/><br/><br/>

		I quickly found out that a lot of UI features that sounded cool in my head are really unintuitive and annoying in practice. For example, the logo on the navigation bar used to be a clickable link that would take you to the very top of the page – except that most people whom I showed the site tried to click it while they were already at the top of the page. It wasn’t clear to people what that button would do – a hallmark of bad design.

		<br/><br/><br/>

		However, I found that the hardest overall aspect of my website to design was the fact that it was my site. Beyond pure aesthetics, I also wanted my site to feel like an extension of myself. It needed a personality. From my current understanding, a site’s personality is the combined result of several properties: typography, spacing, color palette, to name a few. I’ve gone through several designs now and none of them have felt right. I can’t really put into words even what aspects of myself I’m trying to capture, but I’m looking for that one design that’ll eventually just click. To illustrate my point, below are the past iterations of my site, each differently themed.

	<p class="caption">I really like this design, but it felt way too generic for my liking</p>

		<img src="img/thirdsite.png" class="img959x491">
	</div>
	<p class="caption">The current design as of writing. It's a lot more unique, and I'm a big fan of the white color scheme</p>

	<h3 class="subheading">Final Remarks</h3>

	<p class="bottom-text">
		Early on, I would have never expected that the hardest part of building a site would be nailing down a design. As it turned out, learning the basic web development languages was the least of my challenges. Design-sense, as I’ve taken to calling it, is so much harder to learn than any programming language and it’s definitely going to be something I work on for the future. 

		<br/><br/><br/>

		And to any already-great designers out there, feel free to send me some tips.
