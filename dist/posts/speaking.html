	<h1 class="title">Love Letter to Debate</h1>
	<p class="date">01/24/2018</p>

	<p class="text">
		I debated competitively through all four years of high school. By competitive, I mean practices and coaches and tournaments. I was in <i>that</i> crowd.

		<br/><br/><br/>

		For the uninitiated, there are two formats of competitive debate – British Parliamentary and Canadian Parliamentary. In both formats, a standard round of debate consists of both teams being given a resolution and assigned a side, followed by fifteen minutes of prep time. This is when both teams will prepare their arguments for the debate. After these fifteen minutes are over, the round begins speakers will take turns giving speeches from five to ten minutes long, depending on the format. These speeches are normally given in front of a panel of judges, but there can be audiences of a few hundred in the semifinals and finals rounds. At the end, the panel of judges decide the outcome of the round, weighing the arguments presented by each side.

		<br/><br/><br/>

		I don’t debate much anymore these days; schoolwork and side-projects have taken up the free time that debate used to have a monopoly on. Still, I feel like I can apply a lot of the skills I’ve learned from debate to much of my life today. So, I want to take the time and highlight some of these lessons.

	<h3 class="subheading">1. How to explain anything</h3>

	<p class="text">
		This one is to do with communication – I’m sure nobody is surprised that debate could have a few lessons on communication. My coach always said to follow the chain of <i>why</i>. As in, whenever you make a claim, explain why it’ll happen. And then explain why your explanation of the first why happens. Follow this until you get to the basest level of reason. Then, explain the why of that. 

		<br/><br/><br/>

		As a debater, this was done for two reasons. First, you first make sure that nothing is left up to interpretation. This way, our arguments wouldn’t be misinterpreted by the other team or by judges. Second, this tactic also forces you to consider the logic of whatever you’re saying – if you can’t explain a step, something might be wrong. So it also helped to make sure all our arguments were backed up reason. After so much time debating, I naturally do every time I have to explain something – in my writing, while tutoring, or just when talking to people. In a proof-of-how-effective-this-is way and not a toot-my-own-horn way, I’ll share that one of my tutees once said that they much preferred my explanations over their teacher’s.
	</p>

	<h3 class="subheading">2. Be organized and have a plan</h3>

	<p class="text">

		Any debater will tell you that one of the most important parts of a speech is the roadmap. That's the part right in the beginning where we lay out very clearly what's going to happen in the speech. It's the plan. This not only helps us stay on track, it helps listeners follow along too. 

		<br/><br/><br/>

		It’s not uncommon to see speakers walk up to the podium with six or seven pages of notes for their speech. On any single page, there'll be color-coded arrows, boxes, and tables of information. Every debater has a “debate pen” – one of those multi-color ones with the tabs you can click down – specifically to take these notes. This is all for the sake of one goal: staying organized.

		<br/><br/><br/>

		Without those pages as a guide, only the best of the best (read: not me) could still give a coherent speech. It’s one of those things where you really see how much a difference in quality being organized makes. After I saw that, it’s hard not to think about the quality difference being disorganized was causing in everything else I did.
	</p>

	<h3 class="subheading">3. Practice, practice, practice</h3>

	<p class="text">
		For the first three years of my debate career, I would consistently place in the top thirty or forty speakers. Pretty decent showing, but I never received any awards. In the summer before my last year, I found a new partner. This man made me run a practice round with him at least once a day – sometimes two. I filled up two 500-page notebooks with the notes from our practice rounds. For two months, we would practice in real-life, using Skype, and over regular phone calls if we were both on break at work. If it were just me, I would’ve made excuses and procrastinated. With someone else relying on me, being lazy would mean letting down more than just myself; the stakes were higher so it was easier to stay motivated.

		<br/><br/><br/>

		In September of the upcoming year, we nearly made quarterfinals at McGill University’s tournament –questionable shawarma from the previous night incapacitating me during the final round. Then in January, we were the 4th-placing team at Queen’s University, and I received the 5th Top Speaker award for the tournament.
	</p>

	<h3 class="subheading">4. Show some personality</h3>

	<p class="text">
		When I first started off, I thought that people would be more convinced by what I was saying the more seriously they took me. Which is true, to an extent. See, to make sure people took me as seriously as possible, I would try to be very formal in my speeches – big words, a stern expression, rigid posture. It was absolutely genius – the skinny Asian boy in an oversized dress shirt is acting so serious, what he’s saying has to be true!

		<br/><br/><br/>

		This all changed when I watched the finals round at the University of Toronto’s Harthouse Tournament in my second year. Of those eight finalist speakers, not a single one acted the way I did. The best way that I can describe it is that they let their personalities show through their speech. Some cracked jokes, others were passionate, and even the one “serious” speech felt organic and true to the speaker. This made all of their speeches more interesting and because they were interesting, they were more memorable. As a result, their arguments sat with me for longer.

		<br/><br/><br/>

		It made me realize that every speech is a performance. That’s why we’re judged on what we say rather than what’s in our notes. Taking myself so seriously was counterproductive to this performance. More importantly, it also showed me that people respond to personality a lot better than to rigid dryness. In all honesty, maintaining that stupid serious persona was a lot of effort too. Later that week, finally giving a speech without one was a huge relief.

	<h3 class="subheading">Final Thoughts</h3>

	<p class="text">
		Debate has cost me hundreds of hours and my parents thousands of dollars. It was a huge part of my life, and yes, I’d be doing a disservice if I didn’t say the obligatory “I met some incredible people”. Looking back on it now, I can’t say I regret any of it. I’m now a better speaker, a better thinker, more confident in myself, and even have a better haircut (a story for another time). So thank you debate, and thank you Mr. Speaker.
