	<h1 class="title">Debate and Public Speaking</h1>
	<p class="date">01/24/2018</p>

	<p class="text">
		I gave my first speech in a stuffy classroom in front of a few upper-year debaters acting as judges. Even now, I vividly remember being terrified on my way up to the front of the room. Since then I’ve probably given over a hundred different speeches on just as many different topics in front of some pretty big crowds. Somewhere along the way, I grew from someone whose hands would shake during the entire fifteen-minute preparation time into someone comfortable with speaking in front of over two hundred people.

		<br/><br/><br/>

		Even though now I’m still far from being an expert, I’d like to share what I think are the three biggest mistakes you can make as a speaker.

	<h3 class="subheading">1. Taking it too seriously</h3>

	<p class="text">
		One thing I notice a lot with people who are new to public speaking — especially new debaters — is that they try to force a really serious persona. The best way I can think to describe it is a comparison to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqRTGxSGDNs" target="blank">Dean Hardscrabble from Monsters University</a>. And there’s a reason why she was the villain. It’s just cold. And not only is it harder to keep the audience’s attention – you could easily start to seem condescending. At best, your audience is bored; at worst, they become actively hostile. This sort of delivery happens most often when a nervous speaker tries too hard to seem calm and ends up overcompensating. It’s an absolute speech-killer. 

		<br/><br/><br/>

		So what to do instead? Let the emotions show during your speech. This is a much better way to show the audience that you’re comfortable on stage. I used to tell myself to treat each speech like it was a date – it was a good way to remind myself to show personality while speaking. An extra bit of warmth and enthusiasm goes a long way to make you more likeable. And if your audiences likes you, they’re more likely to be engaged in what you have to say. In fact, this approach can help you feel more comfortable while speaking – it’s a lot easier to give a speech without having to worry about maintaining a serious facade. If you’re having fun, then so will the crowd.
	</p>

	<h3 class="subheading">2. Speaking like you write</h3>

	<p class="text">
		People seem to forget that listening to a speech or presentation isn’t like reading a book. Read a sentence you don’t understand? No problem, just go back and reread it. Zone out for a second? Just pick up where you left off. In a speech though, there aren’t any second chances like that so you’ll need to play around that fact. 

		<br/><br/><br/>

		You’ve got to be really clear about everything you say. The goal here is to minimize the risk of anyone in the audience being confused or not being able to follow along. Try to use simple sentences so your points are easier to process. Most importantly though, you should explain everything – even if it’s obvious to you. Audience members don’t have time to connect any dots while they’re listening to you. It’s your job to make sure they understand what you’re saying as you say it. This is where a little bit of repetition is your best friend. Not only is it just generally helpful for emphasizing important ideas – it’s a natural way to let people you’ve lost catch back up with you. When it comes to writing, this is pretty questionable advice – but playing around a unique medium like speech can be what makes a great speaker.
		</p>

	<h3 class="subheading">3. Being disorganized</h3>

	<p class="text">
		Nothing is worse than an unorganized speech. As a long-time debater, I’ve heard my share of them and they’re always scored the worst. The reason for this is that the audience won’t be able to follow your points even if you’re clear in explaining them. For the audience, it's like trying to understand undocumented code. Look at that, I managed to sneak a programming joke into a non-programming post.

		<br/><br/><br/>

		I try to always be very obvious about my speech’s organization. At the beginning, announce what you’ll be talking about and the purpose of each point. An overview like this at the start makes sure the audience is trying to figure out what’s going on while you’re speaking. Then, make it really obvious when you’re transitioning between topics. This is probably the biggest offense when it comes to lack of organization. It’s a really jarring shift that leaves anyone listening confused. I think this happens because when it comes to writing, we’re taught to have smooth transitions from one topic to another. But in speaking, this tactic normally falls flat on its face. Refer back to mistake two for why this is a terrible idea. When I trained new debaters, my advice on this was to always just outright declare a topic change. My favorite phrase for this is “Now let’s talk about <i>x</i>” since it left no room for interpretation. 
	</p>

	<h3 class="subheading">Final Remarks</h3>

	<p class="text">
		To wrap things up, I just want to emphasize most of all that being comfortable with public speaking is, at its core, a matter of practice. It definitely takes some time and it's something I'm still working on myself. That being said, if you're looking to improve your own presentation skills, definitely consider what I've said.
