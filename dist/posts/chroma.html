	<h1 class="title">Reflections on Chroma</h1>
	<p class="date">12/26/2017</p>

	<p class="text">
		When I decided I wanted to make a mobile game, all the programming knowledge I had came from a month of self-taught Java fundamentals and two weeks of Android Studio tutorials on Youtube. This meant that I didn’t have many options when it came to what kind of game I was going to make. I could set up a button, listen for gestures, and navigate to a new screen.
	</p>

	<h3 class="subheading">First Build</h3>

	<p class="text">
		As a result, the first build of Chroma was little more than a set of buttons and a few different screens. The game had a simple premise: tap the color that the word says to move on to the next round. I tried to make it more challenging by having the font color be a different color from the word each time, as well. As a side note, this has actually been psychologically studied – it’s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect">Stroop effect</a>. Overall though, this iteration of the game went smoothly.

	<h3 class="subheading">The Rework</h3>

	<p class="text">
		A few weeks later, I revisited Chroma and decided to polish it some more. I actually really enjoyed this process since I could judge my old work – kind of like when you dig up an essay from eighth grade and wonder what was going through your past self’s brain. I reworked the color-and-text-randomizing-algorithm, revamped the UI, and picked out some royalty-free music I found online.

		Getting the music to work right was probably the biggest challenge I faced in this whole project. MediaPlayer objects don’t play well with the Android activity life cycle so I was getting a lot of strange behaviors, like multiple instances of the music starting, and the music not stopping when a user exited the app. Audio focus was also an issue – the game’s music wasn’t ducking when other apps on the smartphone started playing sound (say an incoming phone call). After two days of Googling and experimenting, I eventually was able to solve all these problems by manually tracking mute settings and changes in the life cycle. 
	</p>

	<h3 class="subheading">Final Remarks</h3>

	<p class="bottom-text">
		I actually had a ton of fun making Chroma – even though it was super frustrating at times. As for the learning experience, developing an app taught me a lot that no online tutorial ever could. Though it wasn’t a huge project, I know I improved a lot as a programmer by having done it.
